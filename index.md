## About Me

I am currently a postdoc fellow working with Dr. Donna Spiegelman and Dr. Laura Forastiere in the Center for Methods in Implementation and Prevention Science (CMIPS), Yale School of Public Health, Yale University.

Before joining CMIPS, I obtained my Ph.D degree in Biostatistics from the University of Waterloo, supervised by [Dr. Grace Y. Yi](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/Yi,%20Grace.html)

I received my Master of Science in Public Health in Biostatistics from Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University and BA in Statistics from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

## Research Interests

> Methodology:

Matrix-variate data analysis, Measurement Error, Causal Inference with Network based Design, Bayesian Analysis, Statistical Machine Learning


>Applications: 

HIV/AIDS prevention; Multi-pollutants and Mixtures in Air pollutions; Brain imaging data (e.g., fMRI, EEG)
